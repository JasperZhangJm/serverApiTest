【response】

answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! Kindly follow these steps to isolate the problem:

1. Adjust the distance between the camera lens and the QR code on your phone.
2. Ensure that the screen brightness is not too dark or too bright.
3. Try placing the phone screen horizontally about 10-15cm in front of the camera and slowly move it away at a distance of 10-15cm. Once scanned successfully, you will hear a "beep" sound.

REMINDER: Make sure to show the FULL PICTURE of the QR code as shown below - WRONG - CORRECT

If you continue to experience issues scanning the QR code, please feel free to contact us for further assistance.

No.41 question: how do you get the camera to work
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! If your camera is not recording any events, there are a few things you can check:

1. Reinstall the app first (if it was working fine before).
2. Make sure the power supply and network connection of the camera are normal. Check if the camera is offline.
3. Check if an SD card is inserted or subscribe to a cloud storage plan. Without storage, the camera cannot save any recorded events.
4. Ensure that the motion detection function is turned on and the notification reminder is enabled. Check also for any message notifications in the app.
5. Open the Aosu app Settings, go to Motion Detection, and disable "Adjust Automatically" if it's enabled. Adjust the Detect Sensitivity to Far Max. This will boost the camera's detection capability.
6. Check if the camera has an available firmware update. Go to Camera settings, Firmware updates, then Update.

If the issue persists, kindly take a screenshot of your Events tab and send it to us for further assistance. We are here to help you resolve this.

Let us know if you need further assistance.

No.42 question: CONFIGURATION ISSUE
【response】
code: 0
answer: Make sure the camera is close to the router. This will ensure a strong and stable Wi-Fi connection. Turn off mobile data and airplane mode on your phone to prevent any interference during the setup process. Confirm that you are using your phone to scan the QR code on the camera correctly. Double-check that you have entered the correct Wi-Fi password without any extra spaces. Reset the camera by pressing and holding the SYNC button for 10-20 seconds until you hear a beep sound and see the green light flashing. Scan the QR code generated in the app and make sure you hear a beep and see the red light flashing more quickly. Finally, check if the indicator light on the camera changes from red to blue. If you're still unable to connect the camera to your Wi-Fi after following these steps, please let me know which step you're stuck on or provide more details about the issue you're facing.

No.56 question: question about the storage in local vs cloud
【response】
code: 0
answer: Video events may be recorded on a card or on the cloud. The card record will be used by default; to use the cloud record function simultaneously, you must activate it first. When it comes to storage methods:

1. **Card Recording**: Video events are recorded on a local SD card, specifically, the 32GB memory of the HomeBase device. The storage is encrypted and uses circular storage, meaning older footage is automatically overwritten. These recordings can only be viewed through the Aosu App.

2. **Cloud Recording**: Video events can be stored on secured cloud servers. Cloud storage offers additional services such as privacy encryption, unlimited storage space, and remote access at any time. You will have the flexibility to access your videos from anywhere with an internet connection.

If you would like to access the cloud storage feature, a payment will be required. You can activate this feature by going to Settings-Cloud Recording-Activate Now-Buy in the app. All users are eligible for a 7-day free trial for the cloud storage service.

No.70 question: The camera is on but the home base won’t connect
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! Kindly follow the steps below to isolate or fix the problem:

1. Check the power source: Ensure that the camera is properly connected to a power source and that the power supply is working correctly.
2. Check the Wi-Fi connection: Ensure that your Wi-Fi network is stable and that the camera is within range of the router. Move the camera closer to the router or HomeBase to see if it improves the connection.
3. Restart the camera: Try unplugging and re-plugging it from the power source, wait for a few seconds, and try again. This can help refresh the connection.
4. Reconfigure the camera: If the issue persists, you can try resetting the camera to its factory settings. Remove the camera from the app and add it back.
5. Check for firmware updates: Go to Camera Settings > Firmware updates, then Update.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide more details about the problem, such as any error messages you're seeing or specific behavior of the camera when the HomeBase won't connect. This will help us further investigate the problem for further assistance. Rest assured we will help you sort this out.

【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for reaching out to AOSU Technical Support. If you have followed all the steps to add a device and it gets stuck at the connecting stage, please ensure that the camera is close to the router for a strong and stable Wi-Fi connection. 

Here are some additional steps you can try:
1. Turn off mobile data and airplane mode on your phone.
2. Double-check that you are using a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network.
3. Confirm you have entered the correct Wi-Fi password without any extra spaces.
4. Reset the camera by pressing and holding the SYNC button for 10-20 seconds until you hear a beep and see the green light flashing.
5. Make sure to scan the QR code generated in the app correctly and listen for a beep and see the red light flashing quickly.

After performing these steps, check if the indicator light on the camera changes from red to blue. If you are still facing issues, please provide more details about the problem you are experiencing so we can assist you further.

【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! Kindly follow the steps below to isolate and fix the problem:

1. Check the Wi-Fi frequency (2.4GHz or 5GHz):
   - Only C2E and C4L models support 5GHz. If unsure, check your router settings or contact your internet service provider for assistance. If on 5GHz, pause the 5G WiFi first, then configure again. Alternatively, request to split the WiFi into two channels 5GHz and 2.4GHz.
  
2. Additional Steps:
   - Ensure the camera is in pairing mode by pressing and holding down the RESET button until a blue light flashes.
   - Check router internet connection stability.
   - Ensure no significant distance between camera and router affecting signal strength.
   - Consider using a WiFi extender if needed.

If the issue persists, consider these troubleshooting steps. If you need further assistance, feel free to reach out to us.

No.88 question: One of my cameras consume power too quick
【response】
code: 0
answer: The battery life of the camera after one charging is typically several months under normal use. However, several factors can affect the battery life, leading to frequent charging. Some reasons include:

- **Local weather**: Charging efficiency of lithium-ion batteries is low when the temperature drops below 40°F / 4°C. 
- **High activity levels**: Frequent triggers such as vehicles and passers-by can lead to more events being captured, reducing battery life.
- **Excessive live video streaming**: Watching live video for extended periods can drain the battery faster.
- **Intense activities**: Adjusting the detection sensitivity to capture more events can increase the frequency of battery usage.

If you experience frequent battery drainage, consider the factors mentioned above and adjust settings as needed to optimize battery life.

No.142 question: my product won't connect to internet
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for reaching out to Aosu Technical Support! Kindly follow the steps below to isolate and fix the problem with your product not connecting to the internet:

Check the Wi-Fi frequency (2.4GHz or 5GHz). Only C2E and C4L models support 5GHz. If unsure, check your router settings or contact your internet service provider for assistance.
If the network is not on 2.4GHz, pause the 5GHz wifi first, then configure again or contact your network provider to split the WiFi into two channels 5GHz and 2.4GHz.
Ensure that the camera is in pairing mode before attempting network configuration by pressing and holding down the RESET button for at least 5 seconds until a blue light starts flashing.
Check if the router has a stable internet connection by verifying if other devices can access the internet successfully.
Check if there is significant distance between the camera and the router, which could impact signal strength and connectivity. Consider moving either device closer or using a WiFi extender if necessary.

If the issue persists, please check for the HomeBase disconnection:

Check if HomeBase is powered off.
Ensure your router has access to the Internet successfully.
Try restarting the router.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to reach out. We are here to help!

No.143 question: Can it record 24 hours?
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! 

Please be advised that Battery-Powered cameras and doorbells do not support continuous recording and cannot record 24 hours. These cameras only record events triggered by motion. If you need a camera that can record continuously for 24 hours, you may want to consider our Power-Plug cameras. You can check the settings for "all-day recording" or "24/7 recording" on the Power Plug camera.
