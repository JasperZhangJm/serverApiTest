No.44 question: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CARD AND CLOUD RECORDINGS
【response】
code: 0
answer: We offer two options for recording video events: on a local SD card or on cloud servers.

1. Card Recording:
   - Video events are recorded on the 16GB memory of the HomeBase device.
   - Storage is encrypted and uses circular storage, meaning older footage is automatically overwritten.
   - These recordings can only be viewed through the Aosu App.

2. Cloud Recording:
   - Video events are recorded on our secure cloud servers.
   - Additional services such as privacy encryption, unlimited storage space, and remote access at any time are provided.
   - Cloud recording services require payment.

To activate cloud recording:
1. Go to Settings in the app.
2. Select Cloud Recording.
3. Choose "Activate Now" and follow the instructions to complete your purchase.

We offer different payment packages based on storage period and package duration such as 14-day monthly, 14-day yearly, 30-day monthly, 30-day yearly, 3-device premium plan (monthly/yearly), and 5-device premium plan (monthly/yearly). Please note that all users qualify for a "7 days free trial" (except for the 14-day monthly plan and premium plans).

If you have multiple devices under your account, each device will need its subscription to access cloud storage. If you want to use cloud storage on another device, open the purchase page in the app and subscribe to the cloud storage service for each device. Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions!

【response】
code: 0
answer: Kindly follow the steps below to isolate and if not, fix the problem:

No.52 question: BATTERY DRAINS QUICKLY
【response】
code: 0
answer: Kindly follow the steps below to isolate the problem:
Fully charge the camera and observe the power consumption speed. This will help you determine if the battery drains faster than expected.
Check for firmware updates. Go to Camera settings > Firmware updates, then Update.
Avoid watching the live feed for a long period if not necessary; watching live for a long time leads to increased power consumption.
If the camera is connected to Smart devices like Alexa and Google, make sure to exit manually if a smart speaker is used to watch the live feed to avoid increased power consumption.
If the camera faces dense crowds and traffic, lower the Detect Sensitivity and enable Human Only to exclude interference from the road.
Let us know if one of these steps works or not.

【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! Kindly follow the steps below to isolate and fix the problem:
Check the Wi-Fi frequency (2.4GHz or 5GHz) - NOTE Only C2E and C4L models support 5GHz. If unsure, kindly check your router settings or contact your internet service provider for assistance.
If the network is not on 2.4GHz, kindly pause the 5G wifi first, then configure again OR contact your network provider and request to split the WiFi into two channels 5GHz and 2.4GHz. This will allow the camera to connect to the appropriate frequency.
If the network is on a 2.4GHz frequency but still has no internet connection, kindly try with the mobile phone's hotspot connection.
Additional Steps:
Ensure that the camera is in pairing mode by pressing and holding down the RESET button for at least 5 seconds until a blue light starts flashing.
Check if the router has a stable internet connection by verifying if other devices can access the internet successfully.
Ensure there is no significant distance between the camera and router that could impact signal strength and connectivity. Consider moving either device closer or using a WiFi extender if necessary.
