No.108 question: Logging problems (not always logging events, some events are missing, not logging)
【response】
code: 0
answer: 1. Please enter the device settings page, find out 'Motion Detection', and turn off 'Human only'. Meanwhile, adjust the Detection sensitivity to the Max;
2. Please click 'About Device' to check if the wifi signal is under 80%. If yes, please try to shorten the distance between the camera and wifi signal base, or please restart the camera and router to ensure the wifi signal becomes better.
3. Please check if the Scheduled Sleep is enabled. If yes, please disable it.
4. If Firmware Updates is available, please try to update it to the latest version.

BTW, if the camera is installed in a position that faces a crowed road or narrow view, it would not detect the motion properly.

If above information does not work for you, could you take several photos to show the camera’s location and camera’s view? I will offer a good solution for you.

No.109 question: Last night, a man came to my door, but my camera didn't record the event
【response】
code: 0
answer: The sensitivity of the PIR Sensor decreases at night, so we recommend increasing the sensitivity and disabling human detection to see if motion can be detected. If it still does not work, we suggest providing us with the SN information of your device and let us know the specific time when the device did not record.

【response】
code: 0
answer: 1. If you believe that events are often missed, please try the following troubleshooting steps:
- Enter the device settings page and adjust the Motion Detection settings. Turn off 'Human only' and set the Detection sensitivity to the maximum.
- Check the wifi signal strength on the 'About Device' page. If it's under 80%, try to improve the signal by adjusting the camera's distance from the wifi base or restarting the camera and router.
- Verify if the Scheduled Sleep mode is enabled and disable it if necessary.
- Check for Firmware Updates and ensure that the camera is not installed in a position that obstructs motion detection.
- Consider increasing sensitivity in "Settings - Motion Detection - Detection Sensitivity" and enabling all message notification types in the notification settings for more notifications.

【response】

answer: Hello! Thanks for reaching out. When the camera is offline, if SD card storage (local recording) is being used, it continues to record video. Videos recorded during the offline period can be recovered and viewed after the camera reconnects to the network. If cloud storage (cloud recording) is used, recordings cannot be made over the network while the camera is offline. During the offline period, cloud storage recordings will be paused until the camera reconnects to the network.

No.147 question: How to install solar panels?
【response】
code: 0
answer: The solar panel must be placed where there is continuous sunlight all the year round. A direct sunlight for several hours a day can suffice for the camera’s power needs. Note: The solar panel may be susceptible to weather conditions, seasonable change, geographic location and other factors.
1. The provided screws are used to secure the mounting base to the desired position. If the surface of the mounting location is soft, a hole may be drilled on the wall by a φ6.0 bit and with an anchor bolt being inserted, and then the mounting base is secured by screws.
2. First of all, install a screw cap to the universal joint, and then screw the round head nut into the universal joint.
3. Screw the universal joint into the back of the solar panel, and secure it with provided nuts.
4. Screw the tightened screw cap into the mounting base. Make sure that the universal joint faces upward.
5. Adjust the solar panel toward left or right, loosen the screw cap, rotate the screw rod, and then tighten the screw cap after the solar panel is properly installed.
6. The angle of the solar panel may be adjusted upward or downward, even up to 90°. Note: After installation, please check whether all connections are tight. Keep the solar panel in a mounting angle of 30-45° from the horizontal plane Connect the solar panel to the camera, as shown in the picture below (open the silica gel cover at the bottom of the camera, plug the power wire in the USB-C charge port, and then close the cover and loosen the power wire on the solar panel).

answer: If you want to add an adapter to wire connect the V8S video doorbell, you need to prepare an 8~24V AC transformer and connect a (10~20 ohm/power above 40W) resistor between the doorbell wiring and the adapter. Once the doorbell is successfully wired, there will be a lightning bolt icon in the battery status in your Aosu app.

answer: Thanks for reaching us, we sincerely apologize for what happened and will help you.

Based on your case, would you please remove the device from your app first, then follow the steps below to see if the doorbell can be connected?

Step 1: Please plug the white color homebase to a power socket.

Step 2: Turn on wifi on your phone and turn off the mobile data.

Step 3: Use your phone, turn on the AOSU app, click the + button on the upper right corner, and scan the QR code on the white color homebase. Then enter the wifi name and password correctly as notified on the app.

Step 4: Press the Sync button on the doorbell for 3S until the blue circular light flashing.

Step 5: When the light is flashing on the white color homebase, press the Sync button on the homebase for more than 5S, until a beep sounds and the green light flashes.

Step 6: Ring the doorbell and you will see the circular light is flashing. At the same time, you will hear the “Dingdong“ from both the doorbell and homebase.

Also, when the doorbell is scanning the QR code on your phone, please do not click the next step too fast until you hear a Beep sound clearly. Otherwise, it may fail.

If the connection fails again, please send us a short video of your connection process and send us the SN no on the white color home. Please do not worry, if the device is defective, we will help you replace it.

Thank you for your cooperation.

answer: "Before each network connection, please confirm that the camera has been reset (long-press the SYNC button at the bottom of the camera until a 'beep' sounds and the green indicator flashes)

- Check whether the SSID is capitalized correctly in the input Wi-Fi information
- Check whether the password is correct in the entered Wi-Fi information

Confirm that the router can connect to the network normally (when the mobile phone is connected to the router, it can be used in the network normally)

- Check the distance between the camera and the router: if the distance is too far or there are obstacles (such as walls, etc.), the overall Wi-Fi signal may be weak.

- Check your router's Wi-Fi encryption type, if it is WEP mode, it is recommended to change it to WPA or WPA2

Confirm that the router does not have a MAC address whitelist set."
