No.19 question: Home base will not connect to network
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support!Kindly follow the steps below to fix the problemMake sure the camera is close to the router. This will ensure a strong and stable Wi-Fi connection. Turn off mobile data and airplane mode on your phone. This will prevent interference during the setup process. Confirm that you are using your phone to scan the QR code on the camera correctly. If your device has a Homebase(Chime), you need to scan the QR code on this part. Check if your Wi-Fi network is 2.4GHz. Some cameras only support 2.4GHz, not 5GHz. Double-check that you have entered the correct Wi-Fi password without any extra spaces. Reset the camera by pressing and holding the SYNC button for 10-20 seconds until you hear a beep sound and see the green light flashing. Scan the QR code generated in the app and make sure you hear a beep and see the red light flashing more quickly. Finally, check if the indicator light on the camera changes from red to blue. If you're still unable to connect the camera to your Wi-Fi after following these steps, please let me know which step you're stuck on or provide more details about the issue you're facing.-Aosu Team

No.41 question: How do you charge the battery? 
【response】
code: 0
answer: The solar panel must be placed where there is continuous sunlight all the year round. A direct sunlight for several hours a day can suffice for the camera’s power needs

Note: The solar panel may be susceptible to weather conditions, seasonable change, geographic location and other factors.
1. The provided screws are used to secure the mounting base to the desired position. If the surface of the mounting location is soft, a hole may be drilled on the wall by a φ6.0 bit and with an anchor bolt being inserted, and then the mounting base is secured by screws.
2. First of all, install a screw cap to the universal joint, and then screw the round head nut into the universal joint.
3. Screw the universal joint into the back of the solar panel, and secure it with provided nuts.
4. Screw the tightened screw cap into the mounting base. Make sure that the universal joint faces upward.
5. Adjust the solar panel toward left or right, loosen the screw cap, rotate the screw rod, and then tighten the screw cap after the solar panel is properly installed.
6. The angle of the solar panel may be adjusted upward or downward, even up to 90°.

Note: After installation, please check whether all connections are tight. Keep the solar panel in a mounting angle of 30-45° from the horizontal plane

Connect the solar panel to the camera, as shown in the picture below (open the silica gel cover at the bottom of the camera, plug the power wire in the USB-C charge port, and then close the cover and loosen the power wire on the solar panel).

answer: 1. How many videos are recorded every day, and whether the video content meets the requirements.
2. Whether there is a long time to watch the live feed, if not necessary, it is not recommended to watch live for a long time. It will lead to increased power consumption.
3. Whether the device connects to Smart devices, such as Alexa and Google Home, remember to exit manually if you use a smart speaker to watch the live feed. Otherwise, it will bring increased power consumption.
4. Whether the device is directly facing the dense crowd and traffic, if so, you can adjust the detection distance to exclude the interference on the road.
5. Check for the firmware update. Settings ---- Firmware Updates.

answer: The sensitivity of the PIR Sensor decreases at night, so we recommend increasing the sensitivity and disabling human detection to see if motion can be detected.If it still does not work, we suggest provide us with the SN information of your device and let us know the specific time when the device did not record.

No.65 question: Videos from today are gone 
【response】
code: 0
answer: There are a few things you can check to fix this problem Make sure the network connection of the camera is normal. Check if the camera is offline. Meanwhile, ensure the wifi signal strength is over 80. If not, the camera always goes offline and misses some events.Check if the motion detection function is turned on. Also, increase the detection sensitivity to the farmax level and disable the "Adjust Automatically". Ensure an SD card is inserted or a cloud storage service is enabled. Without storage, the camera cannot save any recorded events. Check if the camera has a good view. Check if the device's view is wide without closing to a tree or wall, or facing a busy road and crowd. If you have a battery-powered camera (cameras w solar panels), ensure the battery is charged and functioning properly.If you have checked all of these factors and the camera still isn't recording events, please provide a screenshot to show the events page to us. We will resolve the issue for you.- Aosu Team

【response】

answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support!Kindly follow the steps below to isolate and fix the problemCheck the Wi-Fi frequency (2.4GHz or 5GHz)NOTE Only C2E and C4L models support 5GHz. If unsure, kindly check your router settings or contact your internet service provider for assistance.If the network is not on 2.4GHz, kindly pause the 5G wifi first, then configure again OR contact your network provider and request to split the WiFi into two channels 5GHz and 2.4GHz. This will allow the camera to connect to the appropriate frequency. If the network is on a 2.4GHz frequency but still has no internet connection, kindly try with the mobile phone's hotspot connection.Additional StepsEnsure that the camera is in pairing mode before attempting network configuration by pressing and holding down the RESET button for at least 5 seconds until a blue light starts flashing.Check if the router has a stable internet connection by checking if other devices can access the internet successfully.Check if there is any significant distance between the camera and router which could impact signal strength and connectivity. Consider moving either device closer or using a WiFi extender if necessary.-Aosu Team

【response】

answer: Thanks for reaching us, we sincerely apologize for what happened and will help you.

Based on your case, would you please remove the device from your app first, then follow the steps below to see if the doorbell can be connected?

Step 1: Please plug the white color homebase to a power socket.

Step 2: Turn on wifi on your phone and turn off the mobile data.

Step 3: Use your phone, turn on the AOSU app, click the + button on the upper right corner, and scan the QR code on the white color homebase. Then enter the wifi name and password correctly as notified on the app.

Step 4: Press the Sync button on the doorbell for 3S until the blue circular light flashing.

Step 5: When the light is flashing on the white color homebase, press the Sync button on the homebase for more than 5S, until a beep sounds and the green light flashes.

Step 6: Ring the doorbell and you will see the circular light is flashing. At the same time, you will hear the “Dingdong“ from both the doorbell and homebase.

Also, when the doorbell is scanning the QR code on your phone, please do not click the next step too fast until you hear a Beep sound clearly. Otherwise, it may fail.

If the connection fails again, please send us a short video of your connection process and send us the SN no on the white color home. Please do not worry, if the device is defective, we will help you replace it.

Thank you for your cooperation.
