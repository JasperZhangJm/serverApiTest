question:
The battery of the wireless camera kit is draining too fast


respons:
code:0
In the wireless camera kit, the battery life after one charge is designed to last several months under normal use. However, there are various environmental factors at your home that may affect the battery life. Some factors that could lead to faster battery drain include:

1. Local weather: Charging efficiency of lithium-ion batteries is lower at temperatures below 40°F / 4°C, leading to more frequent charging when temperatures are lower.
2. Intense activities: If the camera faces high traffic areas triggering frequent video recording, it can reduce battery life.
3. Detection sensitivity: Adjusting the sensitivity settings leading to more events being monitored can also impact battery life.
4. Continuous live video viewing or prolonged communication through the camera can drain the battery faster.

To improve battery life:
- Ensure the camera is not facing areas with intense activity.
- Adjust detection sensitivity settings.
- Avoid prolonged live view or communication sessions.
- Keep the camera updated with the latest firmware.
- Monitor the number of events detected daily.

If the issue persists, please provide more details for further assistance.


question:
How to charge the battery?


respons:
code:0
Kindly follow the steps below to charge the battery optimally:

1. Ensure the camera is placed in an area with direct sunlight for several hours a day.
2. Check if there is anything blocking the solar panel from receiving sunlight.
3. Verify if the charging cable is working by attempting to charge the camera using a different cable.
4. Make sure the solar panel is not blocked or obstructed.
5. Ensure the temperature in the area where the camera is installed is suitable for charging.
6. Confirm that the solar panel is free from any debris or dirt that might be affecting charging efficiency.

question:
The battery of the wireless camera kit is draining too fast


respons:
code:0
The battery life after one charging is normally several months under normal usage conditions. However, various environmental factors can affect the battery life. Factors such as local weather, the number of events detected and recorded, the number of passers-by and vehicles detected, and the frequency of live video viewing can impact battery life. 

To reduce rapid battery draining, you can consider adjusting the motion detection sensitivity, avoiding frequent live video monitoring, and ensuring the camera is not facing high-traffic areas. Additionally, you may want to check for firmware updates and ensure the camera is not continuously connected to smart devices like Alexa or Google Assistant.

If you encounter persistent battery draining issues, please feel free to reach out to our technical support for further assistance.
