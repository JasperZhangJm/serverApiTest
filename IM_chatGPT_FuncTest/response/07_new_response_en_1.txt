question:
How to select the camera's mounting location?


respons:
code:0
The correct placement of camera is very important for monitoring the desired zone. It depends on various factors, including courtyard layout, distance from mounting location to the street, objects within the field of vision, house height, etc. Please determine the location pursuant to the manual for better monitoring results.

The mounting location, which is relied on your specific monitoring needs, may be decided according to the actual angle of video capture. However, the following principles must be adhered to:

1) At a height around 2-3m (7-10ft) above ground
2) Smaller the horizontal angle and angle of downward inclination of the camera, farther it can detect; but more near field of vision will be sacrificed
3) No camera should be placed under direct sunlight
4) To ensure nighttime photography effects, there should be no shield within a short distance of the camera lens

Note: 
- Connect the device to network before installation
- Promptly enable the real-time video feature for adjusting the mounting location according to the actual capture angle

After the installation, you can readjust the camera’s mounting location according to the actual visual angle displayed in the video in “Settings-Installation Guide”.


question:
Select Height and Location


respons:
code:0
Hang wire-free security camera 7-10 ft (2-3 m) above the ground. This height maximizes the detection range of the motion sensor of the security camera.

For selecting the camera's mounting location, it is crucial to consider various factors such as courtyard layout, distance from mounting location to the street, objects within the field of vision, house height, etc. Determine the location pursuant to the manual for better monitoring results. The mounting location should ideally be around 2-3m (7-10ft) above the ground level to optimize monitoring efficiency.

question:
The battery of the wireless camera kit is draining too fast


respons:
code:0
In the solar-powered camera kit, the battery life after one charging is several months in normal use, but it may be affected by various environmental factors at your home, such as local weather, number of passers-by, vehicles, and other passing objects, as well as the number of events detected and recorded.

Some factors that may lead to frequent charging are detailed below:

- Local weather: The charging efficiency of lithium-ion batteries is very low at a temperature below 40°F / 4°C. Therefore, the lithium-ion battery used by the solar-powered camera needs more frequent charging when the temperature is lower than 40°F / 4°C. The battery performance will return to normal once the weather warms and remains above the ice point.
- Intense activities: If a camera faces the street, vehicles, and passers-by can frequently trigger video recording, which can seriously reduce the battery life. The more events monitored by the camera, the more frequently the battery enables the power supply to the real-time video stream for the device, requiring more frequent charging.

It's important to consider these factors and adjust settings to optimize battery life.
