No.20 question: Home base will not connect to network
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! Kindly follow the steps below to fix the problem: 
Make sure the camera is close to the router. This will ensure a strong and stable Wi-Fi connection. Turn off mobile data and airplane mode on your phone. This will prevent any interference during the setup process. Confirm that you are using your phone to scan the QR code on the camera correctly. If your device has a Homebase( Chime), you need to scan the QR code on this part. Check if your Wi-Fi network is 2.4GHz. Some cameras only support 2.4GHz, not 5GHz. Double-check that you have entered the correct Wi-Fi password without any extra spaces. Reset the camera by pressing and holding the SYNC button for 10-20 seconds until you hear a beep sound and see the green light flashing. Scan the QR code which is generated in the app and make sure you hear a beep and see the red light flashing more quickly. Finally, check if the indicator light on the camera changes from red to blue. If you're still unable to connect the camera to your Wi-Fi after following these steps, please let me know which step you're stuck on or provide more details about the issue you're facing. -Aosu Team

【response】

answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! There are a few things that you may consider on how to get rid of the moist fog inside your camera: 
- Kindly bring the camera back inside (remove it from the original installation point) 
- Try wiping the outer lens cover (not the lenses) with a micro-fiber cloth 
- Try using a hair dryer to heat slightly (not too much heat) OR let it dry for 2-3 days (If the problems occur frequently) 
- Try applying an Anti-fog Spray on the Security Camera's outer lens cover 
- Try putting the camera into a waterproof box, drill a hole in the box, and cover the hole with water-resistant materials until the moisture fog is gone 
- Let us know if you need further assistance.

No.45 question: battery drains in 3 weeks, one of the reasons we bought it for was during absense to see and talk if necessary- lifetime battery is advertised as 6 months !!!!, we dont make 3 weeks !!! 
【response】
code: 0
answer: In the solar-powered camera kit, the battery life after one charging is several months in normal use, but it may be affected by various environmental factors at your home, such as local weather, number of passers-by, vehicles and other passing objects, as well as number of events detected and recorded. Some factors that may lead to frequent charging are detailed below: Local weather The charging efficiency of lithium ion batteries is very low at a temperature below 40°F / 4°C. Therefore, the lithium ion battery used by the solar-powered camera needs more frequent charging when the temperature is lower than 40°F/ 4°C. The battery performance will return to normal once the weather warms and remains above the ice point. Intense activities If a camera faces the street, vehicles and passers-by can frequently trigger video recording, but the user will not be affected because the smart monitoring and motion detection zone settings filter out faraway events. This situation can seriously reduce the battery life. The more events will be monitored by the solar-powered camera, and the more frequently the battery enables the power supply to the real-time video stream for the device. More frequent charging might be required if too many events are captured each day. The battery will also drain faster after long time to watching the live video or long time to talking through the camera each time.

No.66 question: Videos from today are gone 
【response】
code: 0
answer: There are a few things you can check to fix this problem Make sure the network connection of the camera is normal. Check if the camera is offline. Meanwhile, ensure the wifi signal strength is over 80. If not, the camera always goes offline and misses some events.Check if the motion detection function is turned on. Also, increase the detection sensitivity to the farmax level and disable the "Adjust Automatically". Ensure an SD card is inserted or a cloud storage service is enabled. Without storage, the camera cannot save any recorded events. Check if the camera has a good view. Check if the device's view is wide without closing to a tree or wall, or facing a busy road and crowd. If you have a battery-powered camera (cameras w solar panels), ensure the battery is charged and functioning properly.If you have checked all of these factors and the camera still isn't recording events, please provide a screenshot to show the events page to us. We will resolve the issue for you.- Aosu Team

No.93 question: The light turns from green to blue but wont connect 
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! Kindly follow the steps below to isolate and fix the problem. Check the Wi-Fi frequency (2.4GHz or 5GHz). NOTE: Only C2E and C4L models support 5GHz. If unsure, kindly check your router settings or contact your internet service provider for assistance. If the network is not on 2.4GHz, kindly pause the 5G wifi first, then configure again OR contact your network provider and request to split the WiFi into two channels 5GHz and 2.4GHz. This will allow the camera to connect to the appropriate frequency. If the network is on a 2.4GHz frequency but still has no internet connection, kindly try with the mobile phone's hotspot connection. Additional Steps: Ensure that the camera is in pairing mode before attempting network configuration by pressing and holding down the RESET button for at least 5 seconds until a blue light starts flashing. Check if the router has a stable internet connection by checking if other devices can access the internet successfully. Check if there is any significant distance between the camera and router which could impact signal strength and connectivity. Consider moving either device closer or using a WiFi extender if necessary. -Aosu Team

These cameras can only record events that are triggered by motions. However, if you are looking for a camera with a continuous recording capability, you may check and consider our Power-Plug cameras. Please check the settings for "all-day recording" or "247 recording" on the Power Plug camera.-Aosu Team
