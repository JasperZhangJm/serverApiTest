No.19 question: Home base will not connect to network
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support!Kindly follow the steps below to fix the problemMake sure the camera is close to the router. This will ensure a strong and stable Wi-Fi connection.Turn off mobile data and airplane mode on your phone. This will prevent any interference during the setup process.Confirm that you are using your phone to scan the QR code on the camera correctly. If your device has a Homebase( Chime), you need to scan the QR code on this part.Check if your Wi-Fi network is 2.4GHz. Some cameras only support 2.4GHz, not 5GHz.Double-check that you have entered the correct Wi-Fi password without any extra spaces.Reset the camera by pressing and holding the SYNC button for 10-20 seconds until you hear a beep sound and see the green light flashing.Scan the QR code which is generated in the app and make sure you hear a beep and see the red light flashing more quickly.Finally, check if the indicator light on the camera changes from red to blue.If you're still unable to connect the camera to your Wi-Fi after following these steps, please let me know which step you're stuck on or provide more details about the issue you're facing.-Aosu Team

1. Bring the camera back inside (remove it from the original installation point)
2. Try wiping the outer lens cover (not the lenses) with a micro-fiber cloth
3. Try using a hair dryer to heat slightly (not too much heat) or let it dry for 2-3 days if the problems occur frequently
4. Try applying an Anti-fog Spray on the Security Camera's outer lens cover
5. Put the camera into a waterproof box, drill a hole in the box, and cover the hole with water-resistant materials until the moisture or fog is gone.

No.65 question: Videos from today are gone 
【response】
code: 0
answer: There are a few things you can check to fix this problem Make sure the network connection of the camera is normal. Check if the camera is offline. Meanwhile, ensure the wifi signal strength is over 80. If not, the camera always goes offline and misses some events.Check if the motion detection function is turned on. Also, increase the detection sensitivity to the farmax level and disable the "Adjust Automatically". Ensure an SD card is inserted or a cloud storage service is enabled. Without storage, the camera cannot save any recorded events. Check if the camera has a good view. Check if the device's view is wide without closing to a tree or wall, or facing a busy road and crowd. If you have a battery-powered camera (cameras w solar panels), ensure the battery is charged and functioning properly.If you have checked all of these factors and the camera still isn't recording events, please provide a screenshot to show the events page to us. We will resolve the issue for you.

No.92 question: The light turns from green to blue but wont connect 
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! Kindly follow the steps below to isolate and fix the problem:
Check the Wi-Fi frequency (2.4GHz or 5GHz) 
NOTE Only C2E and C4L models support 5GHz. If unsure, kindly check your router settings or contact your internet service provider for assistance. 
If the network is not on 2.4GHz, kindly pause the 5G wifi first, then configure again OR contact your network provider and request to split the WiFi into two channels 5GHz and 2.4GHz. This will allow the camera to connect to the appropriate frequency. If the network is on a 2.4GHz frequency but still has no internet connection, kindly try with the mobile phone's hotspot connection.
Additional Steps
Ensure that the camera is in pairing mode before attempting network configuration by pressing and holding down the RESET button for at least 5 seconds until a blue light starts flashing. 
Check if the router has a stable internet connection by checking if other devices can access the internet successfully. 
Check if there is any significant distance between the camera and router which could impact signal strength and connectivity. Consider moving either device closer or using a WiFi extender if necessary.

【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support!Kindly follow the steps below to isolate or fix the problem
Check the power source Ensure the camera is properly connected to a power source and that the power supply is working correctly. If it's a battery camera, ensure that the battery is charged.

Reconfigure the camera If the issue persists, you can try resetting the camera to its factory settings. Remove the camera from the app and add it back.
Check for firmware updates Go to Camera settings Firmware updates, then Update.
If none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide more details about the problem, such as any error messages you're seeing or specific behavior of the camera when it goes offline. This will help us further investigate the problem for further assistance.
Rest assured we will help you sort this out.
