No.12 question: Why is it asking me to charge the camera? If it’s a solar camera?
【response】
code: 0
answer: In the solar-powered camera kit, the battery life after one charging is several months in normal use, but it may be affected by various environmental factors at your home, such as local weather, number of passers-by, vehicles, and other passing objects, as well as the number of events detected and recorded. Some factors that may lead to frequent charging are detailed below:

- Local weather: The charging efficiency of lithium-ion batteries is very low at a temperature below 40°F / 4°C. Therefore, the lithium-ion battery used by the solar-powered camera needs more frequent charging when the temperature is lower than 40°F/ 4°C. The battery performance will return to normal once the weather warms and remains above the freezing point.
- Intense activities: If a camera faces the street, vehicles and passers-by can frequently trigger video recording, which can reduce the battery life. Adjusting the detection sensitivity and monitoring settings can help manage this.
- Usage: Watching live video for extended periods or engaging in two-way audio conversations can also impact battery life.

If you are observing a decreased battery life, factors such as these may be contributing to the need for more frequent charging. If you have further questions or concerns, feel free to ask, and I'd be happy to assist further.

answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! Kindly adjust the distance between the camera lens and the QR code on your phone. Ensure that the screen brightness is optimal. Try placing the phone screen horizontally about 10-15cm in front of the camera and slowly move it away at a distance of 10-15cm. Once scanned successfully, you will hear a "beep" sound. Remember to show the FULL PICTURE of the QR code.

No.129 question: On your storage coverage what do you mean when it says cover one device does it only cover one camera?
【response】
code: 0
answer: The term "cover one device" in the context of storage coverage means that the cloud storage plan would provide storage for one camera. This means that each camera you have would require its own subscription plan or storage allocation within the cloud service. If you have multiple cameras, each one would typically need its own storage coverage or subscription plan.

【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for reaching out to AOSU Technical Support. It seems you are having trouble connecting to the HomeBase. To troubleshoot this issue, please ensure the following steps:

1. Make sure that the green light is flashing on the HomeBase.
2. Confirm that the HomeBase is connected to a power source and the LAN cable is properly connected.
3. Ensure that the phone with the AOSU app installed is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the HomeBase.
4. Check that the AOSU app has permission to enable the privilege to detect surrounding devices.

If you have completed these steps and are still unable to connect to the HomeBase, please contact your Internet Service Provider for further assistance. Additionally, you may want to consider the following router configurations:
- Configure DHCP on the router.
- Ensure that the MAC white list is not enabled on the router.
- Confirm that AP isolation is not enabled on the router.

If you continue to experience difficulties, please don't hesitate to reach out to us for further assistance. AOSU Technical Support Team.
