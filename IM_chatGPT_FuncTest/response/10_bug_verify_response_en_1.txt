No.1 question: WHAT WILL BE SAVED TO THE CLOUD STORAGE?
【response】
code: 0
answer: Please be advised that cloud storage will only record events up to 60s of maximum duration. If your camera has 247 or continuous recording capability, an SD card needs to be inserted into the camera should you wish to activate this recording type.- Aosu Team

No.3 question: question about the storage in local vs cloud
【response】
code: 0
answer: Video events may be recorded in a card or on cloud. The card record will be used by default; in order to use the cloud record function simultaneously, you must activate it first.

Card Recording: Video events are recorded in the memory of the camera, with an encrypted circular storage, and supporting watch on Aosu App only.

Cloud Recording: Video events are recorded in cloud servers. You will be offered with the services such as privacy encryption, unlimited storage space and remote access at anytime.

Cloud recording services can be used only after payments. Payment process: Settings-Cloud Recording-Activate Now-Buy.

The subscription payment packages are categorized according to the storage period and package duration as: 14-day monthly, 14-day yearly, 30-day monthly and 30-day yearly, 3 device premium plan 30 monthly, 3 device premium plan yearly, 5 device premium plan monthly and 5 device premium plan yearly. All users are qualified for a “7 days free trial (14-day monthly, 3 device premium plan, 5 device premium plan are not included)”.

No.5 question: Can I have recommendations for settings on a camera? It is using too much battery
【response】
code: 0
answer: The battery life after one charging is several months in normal use, but it may be affected by various environmental factors at your home, such as local weather, number of passers-by, vehicles and other passing objects, as well as number of events detected and recorded.

Some factors that may lead to frequent charging are detailed below:

- Local weather: The charging efficiency of lithium ion batteries is very low at a temperature below 40°F / 4°C. Therefore, the lithium ion battery used by the camera needs more frequent charging when the temperature is lower than 40°F / 4°C. The battery performance will return to normal once the weather warms and remains above the ice point.

- Intense activities: If a camera faces the street, vehicles and passers-by can frequently trigger video recording, but the user will not be affected because the smart monitoring and motion detection zone settings filter out faraway events. This situation can seriously reduce the battery life. The higher detection sensitivity you have adjusted, the more events will be monitored by the camera, and the more frequently the battery enables the power supply to the real-time video stream for the device. More frequent charging might be required if too many events are captured each day.

- The battery will also drain faster after watching the live video for a long period or talking through the camera.

No.10 question: Not Recording
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! If your camera is not recording any events, there are a few things you can check: Reinstall the app first (if it was working fine before). Make sure the power supply and network connection of the camera are normal. Check if the camera is offline. Check if an SD card is inserted or subscribe to a cloud storage plan; without storage, the camera cannot save any recorded events. Check if the motion detection function is turned on and the notification reminder is enabled. Check also if there are any message notifications in the app. Kindly open the Aosu app Settings, Motion Detection, disable "Adjust Automatically" if it's enabled, and adjust the Detect Sensitivity to FarMax. This will boost the camera's detection capability. Kindly check if the camera has an available firmware update. Go to Camera settings, Firmware updates, then Update. If it's still not recording, kindly take a screenshot of your Events tab and send it to us. Rest assured we will help you sort this out. Let us know if you need further assistance.

【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! Kindly follow these steps to isolate the problem: Kindly adjust the distance between the camera lens and the QR code on your phone. Ensure that the screen brightness is not too dark nor too bright. Try placing the phone screen horizontally about 10-15cm in front of the camera and slowly move it away at a distance of 10-15cm. Once scanned successfully, you will hear a "beep" sound. REMINDER: Make sure to show the FULL PICTURE of the QR code.

No.12 question: Why is it asking me to charge the camera? If it’s a solar camera?
【response】
code: 0
answer: In the solar-powered camera kit, the battery life after one charging is several months in normal use, but it may be affected by various environmental factors at your home, such as local weather, number of passers-by, vehicles and other passing objects, as well as number of events detected and recorded.

Some factors that may lead to frequent charging are detailed below:

- Local weather

The charging efficiency of lithium ion batteries is very low at a temperature below 40°F / 4°C. Therefore, the lithium ion battery used by the solar-powered camera needs more frequent charging when the temperature is lower than 40°F/ 4°C. The battery performance will return to normal once the weather warms and remains above the ice point.

- Intense activities

If a camera faces the street, vehicles and passers-by can frequently trigger video recording, but the user will not be affected because the smart monitoring and motion detection zone settings filter out faraway events. This situation can seriously reduce the battery life. The more events will be monitored by the solar-powered camera, and the more frequently the battery enables the power supply to the real-time video stream for the device. More frequent charging might be required if too many events are captured each day.

- The battery will also drain faster after long time to watching the live video or long time to talking through the camera each time.

No.13 question: Can't Rotate, PTZ problem, Abnormal Rotating
【response】
code: 0
answer: 1. Please turn off the auto cruise and track motion in the setting.  
2. The camera will auto-rotate once every day at the random time at night for auto-correction. If you have turned the above options off but the cameras still randomly move more than once each day, please check if the exposed cable for the camera is long enough (at least 15CM) and also check if there is a wall blocking the camera's normal rotation.
