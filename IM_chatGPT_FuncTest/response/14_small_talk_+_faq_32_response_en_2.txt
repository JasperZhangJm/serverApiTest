No.27 question: Good evening, Will the camera continue recording if it’s offline?
【response】
code: 0
answer: When the camera is offline, if SD card storage (local recording) is being used, it continues to record video. Videos recorded during the offline period can be recovered and viewed after the camera reconnects to the network. If cloud storage (cloud recording) is used, recordings cannot be made over the network while the camera is offline. During the offline period, cloud storage recordings will be paused until the camera reconnects to the network.
