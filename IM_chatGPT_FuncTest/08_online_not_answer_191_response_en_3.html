No.41 question: how do you get the camera to work
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! If your camera is not recording any events, there are a few things you can check:

1. Reinstall the app first (if it was working fine before).
2. Make sure the power supply and network connection of the camera are normal. Check if the camera is offline.
3. Check if an SD card is inserted or subscribe to a cloud storage plan without storage, the camera cannot save any recorded events.
4. Check if the motion detection function is turned on and the notification reminder is enabled. Check also if there are any message notifications in the app.
5. Open the Aosu app Settings -> Motion Detection -> Disable "Adjust Automatically" if it's enabled -> Adjust the Detect Sensitivity to "Far Max". This will boost the camera's detection capability.
6. Check if the camera has an available firmware update. Go to Camera settings -> Firmware updates, then Update.

If it's still not recording, kindly take a screenshot of your Events tab and send it to us. Rest assured we will help you sort this out.

Let us know if you need further assistance.

No.42 question: CONFIGURATION ISSUE
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support!Kindly follow the steps below to fix the problemMake sure the camera is close to the router. This will ensure a strong and stable Wi-Fi connection.Turn off mobile data and airplane mode on your phone. This will prevent any interference during the setup process.Confirm that you are using your phone to scan the QR code on the camera correctly. If your device has a Homebase( Chime), you need to scan the QR code on this part.Check if your Wi-Fi network is 2.4GHz. Some cameras only support 2.4GHz, not 5GHz.Double-check that you have entered the correct Wi-Fi password without any extra spaces.Reset the camera by pressing and holding the SYNC button for 10-20 seconds until you hear a beep sound and see the green light flashing.Scan the QR code which is generated in the app and make sure you hear a beep and see the red light flashing more quickly.Finally, check if the indicator light on the camera changes from red to blue.If you're still unable to connect the camera to your Wi-Fi after following these steps, please let me know which step you're stuck on or provide more details about the issue you're facing.-Aosu Team

【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for reaching out about the connectivity issue with adding the device. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Based on your case, we recommend the following steps to isolate and resolve the problem:

- Make sure the camera is close to the router to ensure a strong and stable Wi-Fi connection.
- Turn off mobile data and airplane mode on your phone to avoid any interference during setup.
- Confirm that you are scanning the QR code on the camera correctly.
- Check if your Wi-Fi network is 2.4GHz as some cameras only support this frequency.
- Double-check the correct Wi-Fi password without any extra spaces.
- Reset the camera by holding down the SYNC button for 10-20 seconds until you hear a beep and see the green light flashing.
- Scan the generated QR code in the app and ensure the camera's indicator light changes from red to blue.

If you are still experiencing difficulty connecting after following these steps, please provide more details on where you are stuck in the process so we can assist you further.

Thank you for your cooperation.

No.75 question: NETWORK CONFIGURATION FAILED
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support! Kindly follow the steps below to isolate and fix the problem:

1. Check the Wi-Fi frequency (2.4GHz or 5GHz):
    - Note that only C2E and C4L models support 5GHz. If unsure, check your router settings or contact your internet service provider for assistance.
    - If the network is not on 2.4GHz, pause the 5GHz Wi-Fi first, then configure again OR contact your network provider to split the WiFi into two channels 5GHz and 2.4GHz for proper connection.
    - If the network is on a 2.4GHz frequency but still has no internet connection, try with the mobile phone's hotspot connection.

2. Additional Steps:
    - Ensure the camera is in pairing mode by pressing and holding down the RESET button until a blue light starts flashing.
    - Check if the router has a stable internet connection by testing other devices' internet access.
    - Check for any significant distance between the camera and router that could impact signal strength. Consider moving devices closer or using a WiFi extender if necessary.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, feel free to reach out to us for further assistance. -Aosu Team

【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for contacting Aosu Technical Support!Kindly follow the steps below to isolate and fix the problemCheck the Wi-Fi frequency (2.4GHz or 5GHz)NOTE Only C2E and C4L models support 5GHz. If unsure, kindly check your router settings or contact your internet service provider for assistance.If the network is not on 2.4GHz, kindly pause the 5G wifi first, then configure again OR contact your network provider and request to split the WiFi into two channels 5GHz and 2.4GHz. This will allow the camera to connect to the appropriate frequency. If the network is on a 2.4GHz frequency but still has no internet connection, kindly try with the mobile phone's hotspot connection.Additional StepsEnsure that the camera is in pairing mode before attempting network configuration by pressing and holding down the RESET button for at least 5 seconds until a blue light starts flashing.Check if the router has a stable internet connection by checking if other devices can access the internet successfully.Check if there is any significant distance between the camera and router which could impact signal strength and connectivity. Consider moving either device closer or using a WiFi extender if necessary.-Aosu Team

No.150 question: Hi how do you make the camera record longer than 8 sec
【response】
code: 0
answer: Thank you for reaching out! Battery-powered cameras like the AOSU C8L, SolarCam P1 Lite are designed to record events triggered by motion and do not have the capability to change the video recording duration. If you require longer recording times, you may want to consider a power-plugged camera instead. These cameras typically provide options for continuous recording or longer duration recordings. Check the settings for "all-day recording" or "24/7 recording" on a power-plugged camera from AOSU for longer recording durations. Let me know if you need further assistance.
